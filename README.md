# memory

Memory is a small React app, entirely frontend, that tests your memory with cute-as-a-button kitty pics! To play, start clicking on the cat pics, but be careful! Don't click any image that you already clicked. You have to remember what you chose, because if you don't, GAME OVER. Try to beat your top score, but its not that easy; the kitties shuffle around the page after every click.

## Tech/Framework

Kitty-Kat Memory Game is built with JavaScript, Bootstrap CSS, HTML, and ReactJS. There is no backend, so your top score will disappear when you reload. 

## Motivation

This is my first foray into learning React.
